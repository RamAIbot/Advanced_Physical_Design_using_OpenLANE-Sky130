# Advanced Physical Design using OpenLANE/Sky130

<img src="apd.png"/>

A 5 day workshop by VSD on Advanced Physical design using Sky130 PDK and open sourced tools. The OpenLANE opensource flow is used to convert RTL to GDS2. The Picorv32a RISCV processor RTL is converted to final GDS2 layout using OpenLANE flow. The workshop also covered using custom standard cells and adding those in the OpenLANE flow.
